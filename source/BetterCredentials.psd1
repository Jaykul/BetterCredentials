            5.0 Big release (but tiny breaking change)

            1. Added support for Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement (on Windows only). Exposes all credentials in the Windows Credential Manager to SecretManagement.
            2. Added a [BetterCredentials.Credential()] attribute that is compatible with, but better than the built-in one. It supports specifying the Title and Message for the credential prompt, as well as the "Target" and "Description" to be stored in the credential. Of course, since this is BetterCredentials, it also supports automatically saving and loading credentials automatically.
            2. Added a converter to allow casting to different credential types:
                - System.Management.Automation.PSCredential
                - System.Net.NetworkCredential
                - System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCredential

            Breaking changes:
            - By default, Find and Test now search only credentials added by BetterCredentials.
                To get the previous behavior, you need to provide the -AllCredentials switch
            - Removed the -Delete switch from Get-Credential
                It was a bad idea, and we no longer need it, since we added Remove-Credential
                Since this is a breaking change release, might as well remove it



            4.5 Release adds a lot of functionality to the module, allowing enumeration and deletion, etc.

            - Add Test-Credential for explicitly checking whether a credential is already stored
            - Add Set-Credential for explicitly storing or updating stored credentials
            - Add Remove-Credential for clearing stored credentials
            - Add Find-Credential to search stored credentials
